/**
 * Repository interface for {@link UgcAlert} entities, extending {@link JpaRepository}.
 * This interface facilitates the database operations for managing UGC (Universal Geographic Code) alert
 * associations within the application, providing standard CRUD operations.
 * <p>
 * The {@code UgcAlertRepository} specifically handles the {@link UgcAlert} entities that associate
 * geographic zones (represented by UGC codes) with alerts. This repository supports operations such as
 * creating, reading, updating, and deleting UGC alert associations, leveraging the compound key
 * represented by {@link UgcAlertId}.
 * <p>
 * Usage:
 * This repository is integral to interactions involving UGC alert associations. It provides essential
 * data access functionalities to other components of the application that handle alert management and
 * geographic data referencing.
 * <p>
 * As this repository only includes standard methods at the moment, it can be extended with custom query methods
 * if there are specific needs, such as querying alerts by certain criteria related to their geographic relevance
 * or severity.
